*** This is my personal portofolio developed using HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JS.
*** Will be updated frequently as I develop or get involved in new projects.

The design illustrates my view about a person's journey to become a web developer.

***  Phase 1 ***  
 You start at the bottom (the footer of the page) when you are confident that the only thing standing before achieving your dream is a 'blueish' not-so-hard to climb wall (learning the basics of two or three technologies).

 ***  Phase 2 ***  
 You climb that wall and you strongly believe that you've made it, but you find out the hard way that there are hundreds of thousand of people chasing that same dream.

***  Phase 3 *** 
 You start working like crazy but there are lots of ups and downs in this phase.

***  Phase 4 *** 
 You get demoralized. You feel that you're never going to become that developer which you believed you were going to be in phase 1.

 *** Phase 5 ***
 You get back on your feet. There's some normality in this phase. There are good things (colored ones) and not so good things (black & white ones), just as in life.

The process starts again with the phases reversed.
